		<h6>Jack Williams</h6>
		<h6>13<sup>th</sup> November 2021</h6>
		<br>
		<p>In a live stream today, Christopher gave us a cryptic update about the effects of the #EragonRemake tweet storm, and news that we might have our answer from Disney by the end of the year!</p>
		<blockquote class="blockquote text-left" style="margin-left:40px">
			<p class="mb-0">Have I had any traction with Eragon and Disney?</p>
			<p class="mb-0">Oh, what a great question!</p>
			<br>
			<p class="mb-0">Remember I was telling you that there are those things that I can't talk about because my business partners would get mad at me? Well, that's one of those topics.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="mb-0">I think I can say this. I think I can say this. Those giant tweet storms that the fandom did actually made a difference. Now, whether or not this leads somewhere ultimately I don't know yet, but those tweet storms actually made a difference. So from me to you, all you Alagaësians out there, thank you. And I hope to have something to talk about in the near future.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="mb-0">Let's put it this way: I think I will have a definitive answer on a potential remake one way or another hopefully this year.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="mb-0">You know, personally, I feel like it's time. The film, believe it or not, came out, what, 16 years ago, give or take? And 2023 is going to be the 20th anniversary of the hardcover publication of Eragon. So, you know, the nostalgia fic factor is hitting right about now. Folks who were 16 when Eragon came out are mid thirties, late thirties, just like me. Some of them, you may have kids of your own. It's time! It's time to do it again! And hopefully do it well and have fun.</p>
			<br>
			<p class="mb-0">And heck, if the adaptation for To Sleep happens also, then that would be crazy cool. The only problem is I don't know where I'm going to get enough time to sleep and do all the writing I have to do. I'm just trying to average about 2,000 words a day, and that gets me a ton of stuff.</p>

		<h6>Jack Williams</h6>
		<h6>26<sup>th</sup> July 2021</h6>
		<br>
		<p><i><a href="https://brisin.gr/tweetstorm/du-afthringa-frethyai/" target="_blank">Du Äfthringa Frethyaí</a></i>, The Secret Storm, was a success! This one was completely organised by word of mouth, with no public announcement posts, and we still managed to reach trending for a few hours. Even Christopher was surprised - he found out just minutes before the scheduled starting time.</p>
		<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ha! I just found out about this. Five minutes until another tweetstorm: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EragonRemake?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EragonRemake</a><a href="https://t.co/AhtOMimMpP">https://t.co/AhtOMimMpP</a></p>&mdash; Christopher Paolini (@paolini) <a href="https://twitter.com/paolini/status/1419310227803971587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2021</a></blockquote>
		<p>These two successful tweet storms show Disney that we're truly committed and passionate. <i>Du Äfthringa Frethyaí</i> is especially noteworthy as it demonstrates a lot more organic growth than the first tweet storm, which was planned weeks in advance. Browsing the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EragonRemake&src=recent_search_click&f=live" target="_blank">list of latest tweets</a>, one can see that many of the participants had no idea #EragonRemake was a thing at all!</p>
		<p>Sources say it's even harder to get an already-trended hashtag trending a second time, so this was an amazing achievement.</p>
		<p>Just like last time, the fanart blew us all away and revealed just how talented this community is.</p>

		<p>I didn't intend to stream during <i>Du Äfthringa Frethyaí</i>, but by popular request, I did just that. I was first joined by some members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/S2bn8yK6Cy" target="_blank">Arcaena MCAlagaesia  Discord server</a>, and then later hosted a Q&A session with Christopher Paolini alongside Maxime Bocquier (<a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBConceptArt" target="_blank">@MaxBConceptArt</a>) and Malte Wegmann (<a href="https://twitter.com/dnbnumbra" target="_blank">@dnbnumbra</a>). You can watch that here!</p>

		<h1 id="article-01">What did #EragonRemake Accomplish?</h1>
		<h6>Jack Williams</h6>
		<h6>21<sup>st</sup> June 2021 (Updated 23<sup>rd</sup> June 2021)</h6>
		<br>
		<p>Last week, tens of thousands of Inheritance Cycle fans took to Twitter calling on Disney to show the studio the enormous demand for an <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EragonRemake&src=recent_search_click" target="_blank">#EragonRemake</a>. The results were beyond all expectations I had for the event. When the hashtag last trended, it had over 55,500 tweets - <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EragonRemake&src=recent_search_click&f=live" target="_blank">but they're still coming in over a week after</a>, so the true number could be way higher.</p>
		<p class="center"><img src="../img/outcome-tweets.png" /img></p>
		<p>Not only were these numbers far larger than I had even hoped possible, the community was also amazingly creative with their tweets. Endless memes, fanart, music, discussions and debates filled our timelines for days.</p>

		<p>There are many people I need to thank for making this idea so much more than I could have by myself.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To <a href="https://twitter.com/paolini" target="_blank">Christopher Paolini</a>, for being the best author a fandom could ask for. Always active and engaged, and supporting this movement as much as you could.</li>
			<li>To <a href="https://twitter.com/dnbnumbra" target="_blank">Malte Wegmann</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBConceptArt" target="_blank">Maxime Bocquier</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saloalowalomay/" target="_blank">Salomé Hanlon</a> for working on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTwuDQRSrK4" target="_blank">official theme</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxBConceptArt/status/1406629103747411973" target="_blank">art</a>. You brought so much excitement to the event with such high quality work. The talent in this community always astounds me, and gives me <a href="../../agaeti-blodhren" target="_blank">great ideas for the future</a>.</li>
			<li>To the members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/S2bn8yK6Cy">Arcaena & MCAlagaësia Discord Server</a> for being the most supportive group of people while I organised the event, constantly coming up with awesome ideas.</li>
			<li>To the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/" target="_blank">r/Eragon subreddit</a>, where this idea was incubated before becoming a reality.</li>
			<li>To everyone who created fanart, memes and other amazing content to share on Twitter, bringing so much more life to the tweet storm and giving me <a href="../../agaeti-blodhren" target="_blank">great ideas for the future</a>.</li>
			<li>To everyone who shared and promoted this event in advance, to ensure the turnout would be as strong as it was.</li>
			<li>To everyone who showed up and tweeted, making the tweet storm truly blow up beyond all our expectations.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The reaction and result were orders of magnitude beyond anything I expected. Christopher even expressed the same astonishment. You have made this impossible for Disney to ignore. Your contribution has had and will continue to have an amazing impact on the fandom, even beyond a potential new adaptation. Thanks for joining me and making this idea so successful!</p>
